          <p>I am really looking forward to building my own webpage from scratch! This seems pretty similar to what I did in codeacademy 5 years ago or so, but it's really great to try it again because I had really forgotten everything. I hope we learn CSS soon because it seemed really interesting and I want to try out my designer side!</p>
          <p>I'm enjoying the course so far. The TAs and instructors seem super helpful and interesting!</p>
